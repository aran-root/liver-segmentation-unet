# Liver Segmentation with U-Net

This project focuses on semantic segmentation of liver regions from medical images using a U-Net architecture. It was built during my Erasmus year as part of an AI course at the University of Eastern Finland.

## 🧠 What it does

- Loads and processes CT scan images.
- Prepares masks for training.
- Implements a U-Net model using TensorFlow.
- Trains and evaluates the model.
- Visualizes predicted vs real masks.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy, OpenCV, Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📁 Files Included

- `Liver_Ai_Drive.ipynb` → the full notebook with all the code and experiments.
- `Liver Segmentation with U.pdf` → summary report with context, explanation and results.
- (Optional) `results/` folder with prediction visualizations.

## 📌 Notes

This was an academic project with real medical data, focused on learning how to build deep learning pipelines for segmentation tasks. U-Net was chosen due to its strong performance on biomedical images with limited data.
